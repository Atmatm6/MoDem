# MoDem
MoDem is a text adventure reading program. The program is supposed to be very customizable. MoDem is writen in Java so it would need Java SE. To compile, you would need log4j and Jackson.

## Wha?
If you don't know how to compile this, get out but keep on the lookout for a beta release.

## Please human, show some MERCY.
I would very much like it if you didn't compile this just yet. It is still very hard to use and even the adventure is unimplemented.
